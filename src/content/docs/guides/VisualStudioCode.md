Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has emerged as a powerful and versatile code editor, and its seamless integration with Python makes it a favorite among developers. Setting up Visual Studio Code for Python development is a straightforward process that opens the door to a world of efficient coding, debugging, and collaboration. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the steps to set up VS Code for Python development, covering installations, configurations, and essential extensions.

Once the download is complete, follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Installing Python

To develop Python applications in Visual Studio Code, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During the installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" to simplify the setup process.

After the installation, you can verify the Python installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
python --version
```

This should display the installed Python version.
