## Abstract
This is a simple Todo List Application using Python. In this project, you can add, delete, and view the list of tasks. This is a command line based application and uses the txt file to store the tasks. For the features, you can add a task, delete a task, and view the list of tasks. The application will store the tasks in the txt file and will read the tasks from the txt file. The application will also check if the txt file exists or not. If the txt file does not exist, then the application will create a new txt file and store the tasks in it. The application will also check if the task is already present in the txt file or not. If the task is already present in the txt file, then the application will not add the task to the txt file. The application will also check if the task is present in the txt file or not. If the task is not present in the txt file, then the application will not delete the task from the txt file.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE

## Getting Started
### Creating a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it as `todo`.
2. Create a new file and name it as `todo.py`.
3. Create a new file and name it as `todo.txt`.
4. Open the project folder in the text editor or IDE.
5. Copy the code from `todo.py` and paste it into `todo.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to the `todo.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/todo.py" lang="python" title="Todo List App" />
2. Save the File.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\hello_world> python todo.py

5. You can view the tasks in the `todo.txt` file.
```txt title="todo.txt" showLineNumbers{1}
Going for the google summit
```

## Explanation
1. The `import os` statement will import the `os` module.
2. The `import time` statement will import the `time` module.
3. The `import sys` statement will import the `sys` module.
4. The `import datetime` statement will import the `datetime` module.
5. The `def add_task():` statement will define a function named `add_task`. It will add a task to the todo list. It will take no parameters.
6. `add_task()` function write the task to the `todo.txt` file using the `with open("todo.txt", "a") as f:` statement. It append the task at the end of the file.
7. The `def view_task():` statement will define a function named `view_task`. It will view all tasks in the todo list. It will take no parameters.
8. `view_task()` function read the tasks from the `todo.txt` file using the `with open("todo.txt", "r") as f:` statement.
9. The `def delete_task():` statement will define a function named `delete_task`. It will delete a task from the todo list. It will take no parameters.
10. `delete_task()` function read the tasks from the `todo.txt` file using the `with open("todo.txt", "r") as f:` statement. It will ask the user to enter the task number to delete. It will delete the task from the `todo.txt` file using the `del tasks[task_no - 1]` statement.
11. The `def delete_all_task():` statement will define a function named `delete_all_task`. It will delete all tasks from the todo list. It will take no parameters.
12. `delete_all_task()` function read the tasks from the `todo.txt` file using the `with open("todo.txt", "r") as f:` statement. It will ask the user to confirm the deletion of all tasks. It will delete all tasks from the `todo.txt` file using the `with open("todo.txt", "w") as f:` statement.
13. The `def exit():` statement will define a function named `exit`. It will exit the application. It will take no parameters. It will ask the user to confirm the exit. It will exit the application using the `sys.exit()` statement.
14. The `def restart():` statement will define a function named `restart`. It will restart the application. It will take no parameters. It will ask the user to confirm the restart. It will restart the application using the `os.system("python todo.py")` statement.
15. The `def help():` statement will define a function named `help`. It will display the help. It will take no parameters. It will display the help using the `print()` statement. It helps the user to use the application.
16. The `print("Todo Application")` statement will display the Todo Application text on the screen.
17. We are going to use `while` loop to run the application continuously. The `while True:` statement will create an infinite loop.
18. When the user wants to exit the application, then the `sys.exit()` statement will exit the application.

## Next Steps
Congratulations you have successfully created a Todo List Application using Python. Experiment with the code and try to modify it.

Here are a few suggestions:
1. Add a feature to edit a task.
2. Add a feature to sort the tasks.
3. Add a feature to search for a task.
4. Add a feature to add a task to a specific position.
5. Add a feature to add a task to a specific date.
6. Add a feature to add a task to a specific time.
7. Add a feature to add a task to a specific date and time.
8. Add a feature to add a task to a specific date and time and set a reminder.
9. Add a feature to add a task to a specific date and time and set a reminder and repeat the task.
10. Add a feature to add a task to a specific date and time and set a reminder and repeat the task and set a priority.

You also learned how to use the `os` module, `time` module, `sys` module, and `datetime` module. You also learned how to use the `with` statement. You also learned how to use the `while` loop. You also learned how to use the `if` statement. You also learned how to use the `elif` statement. You also learned how to use the `else` statement. You also learned how to use the `def` statement. You also learned how to use the `print()` function. You also learned how to use the `input()` function. You also learned how to use the `open()` function.
