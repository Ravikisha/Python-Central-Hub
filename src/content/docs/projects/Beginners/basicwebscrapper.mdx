## Abstract
This is a basic web scrapper that scrapes the data from the website and stores it in a csv file. This is a beginner level project. We are going to use the BeautifulSoup library for this project and requests library to get the data from the website. In this application, we are going to scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch and store the data in a csv file. We are going to scrape the data of the product name, price, and description of the product.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- BeautifulSoup library
- requests library
- Text editor or IDE

## Before we start
Before we start, we need to install the BeautifulSoup library and requests library. To install the BeautifulSoup library, we need to run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\username>pip install beautifulsoup4
```

To install the requests library, we need to run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\username>pip install requests
```

## Getting Started
### Creating a project
1. Create a folder named `basicwebscrapper` and open it in the text editor or IDE.
2. Create a file named `basicwebscrapper.py` in the `basicwebscrapper` folder.
3. Open the `basicwebscrapper.py` file in the text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `basicwebscrapper.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Copy and paste the following code into the `basicwebscrapper.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/basicwebscrapper.py" lang="python" title="Basic Web Scrapper" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in the `basicwebscrapper` folder.
4. Run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}

## Explanation
1. First, we import the `requests` library and the `BeautifulSoup` library.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
2. Then, we assign the URL to the variable `url`.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
url = "https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch"
```
3. Next, we request the URL and assign it to the variable `response`. Then, we parse the HTML using the `html.parser` and assign it to the variable `soup`.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
```
4. After that, we find all the phones and assign it to the variable `phones`.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
phones = soup.find_all("div", class_="card-body")
```
5. Then, we create a CSV file named `phones.csv` and open it in append mode. Then, we write the headers to the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
open_file = open("phones.csv", "a")
headers = "Name, Price, Description, Reviews, Rating, Image\n"
open_file.write(headers)
```
6. Next, we loop through the phones and find the name, price, description, reviews, rating, and image of the phone. Then, we write the data to the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
name = phone.find("a", class_="title")
price = phone.find("h4", class_="price")
```

and so on...

after that, we write the data to the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
open_file.write(f'{name.text}, {price.text}, {description.text}, {reviews.text}, {rating["data-rating"]}, {image}\n')
```
7. Finally, we close the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
open_file.close()
```

## Usage
1. Open the terminal in the `basicwebscrapper` folder.
2. Run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\username\basicwebscrapper>python basicwebscrapper.py
```
3. The data will be scraped from the website and stored in the `phones.csv` file.
4. The data will be printed in the terminal.
5. The data will be stored in the `phones.csv` file.
```csv title="phones.csv" showLineNumbers{1} {1-9}

6. The data will be printed in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2-60}

## Next Steps
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ you have successfully created a basic web scrapper that scrapes the data from the website and stores it in a csv file. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:
1. Scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/laptops and store the data in a csv file.
2. Scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/computers/tablets and store the data in a csv file.
3. Add a feature to scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch and store the data in a json file.
4. Add a feature to scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch and store the data in a database.
5. Create a GUI for the application.
6. Create a web application for the application.
7. Add a cron_job to scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch and store the data in a csv file every 24 hours.
:::note
cron_job is a task scheduler in Unix-like systems that schedules tasks to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
