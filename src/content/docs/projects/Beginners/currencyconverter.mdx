This project is a very simple project that makes a user-friendly interface. This project is very helpful for beginners who want to learn to code in python. This project is very easy to operate and understood by the users. You can access 20 different currencies in this project. You can convert any currency to any currency. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE
- Request module
- BeautifulSoup module

## Before you Start
Before starting making this project, you must have python installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have python installed you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You must have a code editor or IDE installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have any code editor or IDE installed you can download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You must have the request module and BeautifulSoup module installed on your computer. If you donâ€™t have these modules installed you can install them by using the following commands in your terminal. 

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install requests
C:\Users\Your Name>pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `CurrencyConverter`.
2. Open the folder in your code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `currencyconverter.py`.
4. Copy the code given code and paste it in your `currencyconverter.py` file.

```
4. You can see the output in the terminal.

## Explanation
1. First, we have imported the required modules. We have imported the `requests` module and `BeautifulSoup` module. We have imported the `requests` module to request the URL and the `BeautifulSoup` module to parse the HTML.
```python title="currencyconverter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

2. Then we have created a variable named `url` and assigned the URL to it. We have used `%s` to add the variables in the URL.
```python title="currencyconverter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
url = "https://www.x-rates.com/calculator/?from=%s&to=%s&amount=%s"
```

3. Then we have printed the list of currencies. We have used the `print()` function to print the list of currencies.
```python title="currencyconverter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-40}
print("Currency Converter")
print('''

        2. EUR - Euro
        3. GBP - British Pound
        4. INR - Indian Rupee
        5. AUD - Australian Dollar
        6. CAD - Canadian Dollar
        7. SGD - Singapore Dollar
        8. CHF - Swiss Franc
        9. MYR - Malaysian Ringgit
        10. JPY - Japanese Yen
        11. CNY - Chinese Yuan Renminbi
        12. NZD - New Zealand Dollar
        13. THB - Thai Baht
        14. HUF - Hungarian Forint
        15. AED - Emirati Dirham
        16. HKD - Hong Kong Dollar
        17. MXN - Mexican Peso
        18. ZAR - South African Rand
        19. PHP - Philippine Peso
        20. SEK - Swedish Krona
        
        Don't Enter the Number. Enter the currency code.
    ''')
```

4. Then we have used the `input()` function to get the user input. We have used the `upper()` function to convert the user input to uppercase. We have used the `input()` function to get the user input. We have used the `upper()` function to convert the user input to uppercase.
```python title="currencyconverter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
from_currency = input("From Currency: ").upper()
to_currency = input("To Currency: ").upper()
amount = input("Amount: ")
```

5. Then we have requested the URL. We have used the `get()` function to request the URL. We have used the `find()` function to find the converted amount. We have used the `text` attribute to get the text from the HTML. We have used the `find()` function to find the converted amount. We have used the `text` attribute to get the text from the HTML.
```python title="currencyconverter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
response = requests.get(url % (from_currency, to_currency, amount))
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
converted_amount = soup.find("span", class_="ccOutputRslt").text
```

6. Then we have printed the converted amount. We have used the `print()` function to print the converted amount.
```python title="currencyconverter.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
print(f'{amount} {from_currency} = {converted_amount}')
```

## Next Steps
Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully created a Currency Converter in Python. 

There are many ways to improve this program. Here are some ideas:
- Add more currencies.
- Add a GUI to this program.
- Add a database to this program.
- Add a history feature to this program.
- Add a feature to this program to convert the currency of a country to all the other currencies.
- Add a feature to this program to convert the currency of all the countries to the currency of a country.
