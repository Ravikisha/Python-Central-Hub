## Abstract
Dice Rolling Simulator is a simple Python program that rolls a dice and gives you a random number between 1 and 6. You can use this to play board games or just for fun. This is a command line program. It helps you to learn about random module in Python. In this article, we will learn how to create a dice rolling simulator using Python. It uses Random module to generate random numbers. Also, we will learn how to create a function in Python. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- A code editor or IDE

## Getting Started
#### Create a Project
1. Create a folder named `dice-rolling-simulator`.
2. Open the folder in your code editor or IDE.
3. Create a file named `dicerolling.py`.
4. Copy the code given above and paste it in the `dicerolling.py` file.

## Write the Code
1. Copy and paste the following code in the `dicerolling.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/dicerolling.py" lang="python" title="Dice Rolling" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder `dice-rolling-simulator`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\username\PythonCentralHub\projects\beginners\dice-rolling-simulator> python dicerolling.py
You rolled 4
Do you want to roll again? (y/n): y
You rolled 5
Do you want to roll again? (y/n): y
You rolled 5
Do you want to roll again? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing!
```
4. You can see the output in the terminal.

## Explanation
1. First, we need to import the `random` module. We will use this module to generate random numbers.
```python title="dicerolling.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
import random
```

2. Next, we need to create a function to roll the dice. We will use the `randint()` function from the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 6.
```python title="dicerolling.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
def roll():
    return random.randint(1, 6)
```

3. Now, we need to call the `roll()` function to roll the dice. We will use a `while` loop to roll the dice until the user wants to stop.
```python title="dicerolling.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-7}
while True:
    print(f"You rolled {roll()}")
    play_again = input("Do you want to roll again? (y/n): ")
    if play_again.lower() != "y":
        break
```

4. Finally, we need to print a message to the user.
```python title="dicerolling.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-9}
print("Thanks for playing!")
```

## Next Steps
Congratulations! You have successfully created a dice rolling simulator using Python.

There are many ways to improve this program. Here are some ideas:
- Add a feature to roll multiple dice at once.
- Add a feature to roll a dice with more than 6 sides.
- Add a feature to roll a dice with different colors.
- Add a feature to roll a dice with different shapes.
- Create a GUI version of this program.
- Create a web version of this program.
