{/* ```python title="input.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + user_name + "!")
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {3}
C:\Users\Your Name> python input.py
Enter your name: John
Hello, John!
```

In this snippet, the `input()` function displays the prompt ("Enter your name: ") and waits for the user to input their name. The entered value is then stored in the variable `user_name` and used in the subsequent `print()` statement. */}

## Abstract
This is a basic chatbot that can answer some basic questions. You have some predefined commands that you can ask the chatbot and it will answer you accordingly. In this chatbot, you can ask the chatbot to open youtube, google, stackoverflow, play music, tell you the time, open code, and send an email to someone. This is inspire by Jarvis Project From CodeWithHarry.
