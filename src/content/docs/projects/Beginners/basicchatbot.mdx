```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {3}
C:\Users\Your Name> python input.py
Enter your name: John
Hello, John!
```

In this snippet, the `input()` function displays the prompt ("Enter your name: ") and waits for the user to input their name. The entered value is then stored in the variable `user_name` and used in the subsequent `print()` statement. */}

## Abstract
This is a basic chatbot that can answer some basic questions. You have some predefined commands that you can ask the chatbot and it will answer you accordingly. In this chatbot, you can ask the chatbot to open youtube, google, stackoverflow, play music, tell you the time, open code, and send an email to someone. This is inspire by Jarvis Project From CodeWithHarry.

## Explanation
1. Import the required modules.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
import pyttsx3 #pip install pyttsx3
import speech_recognition as sr #pip install speechRecognition
import datetime
import wikipedia #pip install wikipedia
import webbrowser
import os
import smtplib
```

2. Initialize the pyttsx3 module.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
engine = pyttsx3.init('sapi5')
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)
```

3. Define a function `speak()` that will take `audio` as an argument and will speak the `audio` that is passed to it.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
def speak(audio):
    engine.say(audio)
    engine.runAndWait()
```

4. Define a function `wishMe()` that will wish you according to the time.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-20}
def wishMe():
    hour = int(datetime.datetime.now().hour)
    if hour>=0 and hour<12:
        speak("Good Morning!")

    elif hour>=12 and hour<18:
        speak("Good Afternoon!")   

    else:
        speak("Good Evening!")  

    speak("I am Jarvis Sir. Please tell me how may I help you")       
```

5. Define a function `takeCommand()` that will take microphone input from the user and returns string output.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-30}
def takeCommand():
    #It takes microphone input from the user and returns string output

    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        r.pause_threshold = 1
        audio = r.listen(source)

    try:
        print("Recognizing...")    
        query = r.recognize_google(audio, language='en-in')
        print(f"User said: {query}\n")

    except Exception as e:
        # print(e)    
        print("Say that again please...")  
        return "None"
    return query
```

6. Define a function `sendEmail()` that will send an email to the person you want to send an email to.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-14}
def sendEmail(to, content):
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.ehlo()
    server.starttls()
    server.login('youremail@gmail.com', 'your-password') # Enter your email and password at
    server.sendmail('youremail@gmail.com', to, content) # Enter your email at youremail@gmail
    server.close()
```

7. Define the main function `main()` that will call all the functions.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-4}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wishMe()
    while True:
```

8. Call the `takeCommand()` function and store the returned value in the variable `query`.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wishMe()
    while True:
    # if 1:
        query = takeCommand().lower()
```

9. Check if the word `wikipedia` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `speak()` function and speak the following lines.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-10}
if 'wikipedia' in query:
    speak('Searching Wikipedia...')
    query = query.replace("wikipedia", "")
    results = wikipedia.summary(query, sentences=2)
    speak("According to Wikipedia")
    print(results)
    speak(results)
```

10. Check if the word `open youtube` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `webbrowser.open()` function and open youtube.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
elif 'open youtube' in query:
    webbrowser.open("youtube.com")
```

11. Check if the word `open google` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `webbrowser.open()` function and open google.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
elif 'open google' in query:
    webbrowser.open("google.com")
```

12. Check if the word `open stackoverflow` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `webbrowser.open()` function and open stackoverflow.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
elif 'open stackoverflow' in query:
    webbrowser.open("stackoverflow.com")   
```

13. Check if the word `play music` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `os.listdir()` function and list all the files in the music directory. Then call the `os.startfile()` function and play the first song in the music directory.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-6}
elif 'play music' in query:
    music_dir = 'Your Music Directory' # Enter your music directory here like C:\\Users\\Ravi\\Music
    songs = os.listdir(music_dir)
    print(songs)    
    os.startfile(os.path.join(music_dir, songs[0]))
```

14. Check if the word `the time` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `datetime.datetime.now()` function and get the current time. Then call the `speak()` function and speak the current time.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-4}
elif 'the time' in query:
    strTime = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")    
    speak(f"Sir, the time is {strTime}")
```

15. Check if the word `open code` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `os.startfile()` function and open the code.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
elif 'open code' in query:
    codePath = "C:\\Users\\Ravi\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code\\Code.exe"
    os.startfile(codePath)
```

16. Check if the word `email to ravi` is in the `query` variable. If it is in the `query` variable then call the `speak()` function and speak the following lines. Then call the `takeCommand()` function and store the returned value in the variable `content`. Then call the `sendEmail()` function and send the email to the person you want to send the email to.
```python title="basicchatbot.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-14}
elif 'email to ravi' in query:
    try:
        speak("What should I say?")
        content = takeCommand()
        to = "ravi@gmail.com"
        sendEmail(to, content)
        speak("Email has been sent!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        speak("Sorry. I am not able to send this email")
```

## Usage
1. Open the terminal in your code editor or IDE and navigate to the folder `basicchatbot`.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
C:\Users\Your Name\basicchatbot> python basicchatbot.py
```
2. Run the `basicchatbot.py` file.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
C:\Users\Your Name\basicchatbot> python basicchatbot.py
```
3. Now you can ask the chatbot to open youtube, google, stackoverflow, play music, tell you the time, open code, and send an email to someone.

## Output
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1-30}
C:\Users\Your Name\basicchatbot> python basicchatbot.py
