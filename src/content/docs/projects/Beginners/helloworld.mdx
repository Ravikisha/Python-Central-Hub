## Abstract
Creating a "Hello World" project is a classic and essential first step for anyone learning a new programming language. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of building a simple "Hello World" project using Python. This project serves as a foundation for understanding basic syntax, setting up a development environment, and executing a Python script.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Getting Started
### Create a new project
1. Open Text Editor or IDE
2. Select **File** > **New File** from the menu bar
3. Select **File** > **Save As** from the menu bar
4. Name the file `hello_world.py`
5. Select **File** > **Save** from the menu bar

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to the file:
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/helloworld.py" lang="python" title="Hello World" />
2. Select **File** > **Save** from the menu bar
3. Select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu bar
4. In the terminal, 
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\username\Documents\hello_world> python hello_world.py
Hello World!
```

## Next Steps
Congratulations! You've successfully created a "Hello World" project using Python. Now that you've completed this project, you can continue learning Python by completing the next project in the series on Python Central Hub. You can find the complete source code of this project on [Github](https://github.com/Ravikisha/PythonCentralHub/blob/main/projects/beginners/helloworld.py).
