## Abstract
Creating a simple calculator is a great project for beginners. You will learn how to use functions, return values, and if statements. In this project, you will create a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. You can also calculate the square root of a number and power of a number. This application is a command-line application. You can run this application in the terminal.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE

## Getting Started
### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `simple-calculator`.
2. Create a new file and name it `calculator.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Open the `calculator.py` file in your text editor or IDE.

### Write the code
1. Add following code to the `calculator.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/calculator.py" lang="python" title="Simple Calculator" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\simple-calculator> python calculator.py
Select Operation.
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Square Root
6. Power
E. Exit
R. Restart
Enter Choice (1/2/3/4/5/6/E/R): 1
Enter First Number: 2
Enter Second Number: 4
2.0 + 4.0 = 6.0
Enter Choice (1/2/3/4/5/6/E/R): E
Are you sure you want to exit? (Y/N): Y
Exiting...
```

## Explanation
In this application, we create some functions to perform the mathematical operations. We use the `math` module to calculate the square root and power of a number. 

We use the `while` loop to run the application until the user exits the application. We use the `if` statement to check the user input and perform the operation accordingly. We use the `input()` function to get the user input. We use the `float()` function to convert the user input to a floating-point number. We use the `print()` function to print the output to the terminal. We use the `break` statement to exit the `while` loop. We use the `upper()` function to convert the user input to uppercase. We use the `elif` statement to check multiple conditions. We use the `else` statement to execute the code if the `if` statement condition is `False`. We use the `return` statement to return the value from the function. We use the `def` keyword to define a function. We use the `import` keyword to import the `math` module. We use the `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of a number. We use the `math.pow()` function to calculate the power of a number.

#### The Usage Guide
- If you want to perform the addition operation, you can press the `1` key. 
- If you want to perform the subtraction operation, you can press the `2` key.
- If you want to perform the multiplication operation, you can press the `3` key.
- If you want to perform the division operation, you can press the `4` key.
- If you want to calculate the square root of a number, you can press the `5` key.
- If you want to calculate the power of a number, you can press the `6` key.
- If you want to exit the application, you can press the `E` or `e` key.
- If you want to restart the application, you can press the `R` or `r` key.

## Next Steps
You can add more mathematical operations to this application. You can add the following operations to this application.
- Factorial
- Logarithm
- Trigonometric Functions
- Exponential Functions
- Hyperbolic Functions
- Rounding Functions
- Summation Functions
- Product Functions
- More Mathematical Functions
