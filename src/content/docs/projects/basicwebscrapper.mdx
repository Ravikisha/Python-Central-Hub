## Abstract
This is a basic web scrapper that scrapes the data from the website and stores it in a csv file. This is a beginner level project. We are going to use the BeautifulSoup library for this project and requests library to get the data from the website. In this application, we are going to scrape the data from the website https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch and store the data in a csv file. We are going to scrape the data of the product name, price, and description of the product.

{/* <!-- ```python title="tuple_index.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-5}
data = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j')
print(data[0])
print(data[1])
print(data[2])
print(data[3])
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2-5}
C:\Users\username>python tuple_index.py
a
b
c
d
```

In this example, we declare a tuple and assign it to the variable `data`. We then print the tuple elements using the index number. The output shows that the tuple elements are accessed using the index number. --> */}

# Basic Web Scrapper

# Importing Libraries
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# URL
url = "https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch"

# Requesting the URL
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# Finding the phones
phones = soup.find_all("div", class_="card-body")

# Creating a CSV file
open_file = open("phones.csv", "a")
headers = "Name, Price, Description, Reviews, Rating, Image\n"
open_file.write(headers)

# Looping through the phones
for phone in phones:
    name = phone.find("a", class_="title")
    price = phone.find("h4", class_="price")
    description = phone.find("p", class_="description")
    reviews = phone.find("p", class_="float-end review-count")
    rating = phone.find("p", attrs={"data-rating": True})
    image = phone.find("img", class_="img-responsive")["src"]
    
    # Writing to the CSV file
    open_file.write(f'{name.text}, {price.text}, {description.text}, {reviews.text}, {rating["data-rating"]}, {image}\n')
    print(f'Name: {name.text} \nPrice: {price.text} \nDescription: {description.text} \nReviews: {reviews.text} \nRating: {rating["data-rating"]} \nImage: {image} \n')

# Closing the CSV file
open_file.close()   
     */}

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- BeautifulSoup library
- requests library
- Text editor or IDE

## Before we start
Before we start, we need to install the BeautifulSoup library and requests library. To install the BeautifulSoup library, we need to run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\username>pip install beautifulsoup4
```

To install the requests library, we need to run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
C:\Users\username>pip install requests
```

## Getting Started
### Creating a project
1. Create a folder named `basicwebscrapper` and open it in the text editor or IDE.
2. Create a file named `basicwebscrapper.py` in the `basicwebscrapper` folder.
3. Open the `basicwebscrapper.py` file in the text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into the `basicwebscrapper.py` file.

### Write the code
1. Copy and paste the following code into the `basicwebscrapper.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/basicwebscrapper.py" lang="python" title="Basic Web Scrapper" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal in the `basicwebscrapper` folder.
4. Run the following command in the terminal.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {1}

## Explanation
1. First, we import the `requests` library and the `BeautifulSoup` library.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```
2. Then, we assign the URL to the variable `url`.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
url = "https://webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone/phones/touch"
```
3. Next, we request the URL and assign it to the variable `response`. Then, we parse the HTML using the `html.parser` and assign it to the variable `soup`.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
```
4. After that, we find all the phones and assign it to the variable `phones`.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
phones = soup.find_all("div", class_="card-body")
```
5. Then, we create a CSV file named `phones.csv` and open it in append mode. Then, we write the headers to the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-3}
open_file = open("phones.csv", "a")
headers = "Name, Price, Description, Reviews, Rating, Image\n"
open_file.write(headers)
```
6. Next, we loop through the phones and find the name, price, description, reviews, rating, and image of the phone. Then, we write the data to the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
name = phone.find("a", class_="title")
price = phone.find("h4", class_="price")
```

and so on...

after that, we write the data to the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1-2}
open_file.write(f'{name.text}, {price.text}, {description.text}, {reviews.text}, {rating["data-rating"]}, {image}\n')
```
7. Finally, we close the CSV file.
```python title="basicwebscrapper.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1}
open_file.close()
```
