title: Rock Paper Scissors Game
description: This is a simple rock paper scissors game made using python. This is a beginner level project. You can find the code for this project on my GitHub. In this project, we will use the random module to generate random numbers and then we will use if-else statements to check the user input and computer generated number and then we will decide the winner.
