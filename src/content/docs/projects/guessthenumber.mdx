## Abstract
This is a simple game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 20. You will learn how to use a while loop with a break statement. In this application, computer will choose a random number between 1 and 20, and the user will have to guess the number. If the user guesses wrong, the program will tell the user if the guess is too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, the program will congratulate the user and end the game. If the user fails to guess the number within six tries, the program will tell the user the number and end the game.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or above
- Text Editor or IDE

## Getting Started
### Create a new project
1. Create a new project folder and name it `guessTheNumberGame`.
2. Create a new file and name it `guessTheNumberGame.py`.
3. Open the project folder in your favorite text editor or IDE.
4. Copy the code below and paste it into your `guessTheNumberGame.py` file.

## Write the code
1. Add the following code to your `guessTheNumberGame.py` file.
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/guessthenumber.py" lang="python" title="Guess The Number" />
2. Save the file.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the following command to run the application.
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\hello_world> python guessthenumber.py
Hello, what is your name?
Ravi
Well, Ravi, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
Take a guess. You have 6 guesses left.
23
Your guess is too high.
Take a guess. You have 5 guesses left.
12
Your guess is too high.
Take a guess. You have 4 guesses left.
11
Your guess is too high.
Take a guess. You have 3 guesses left.
7
Your guess is too high.
Take a guess. You have 2 guesses left.
5
Good job, Ravi! You guessed my number in 5 guesses.
```

## Explanation
1. The `import random` statement will import the random module into your program. This will allow you to generate random numbers.
2. The `print('Hello, what is your name?')` statement will print the string `Hello, what is your name?` to the console.
3. The `name = input()` statement will prompt the user to enter their name and store the value in the `name` variable.
4. The `print('Well, ' + name + ', I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.')` statement will print the string `Well, ` followed by the value of the `name` variable, followed by the string `, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.` to the console.
5. The `secretNumber = random.randint(1, 20)` statement will generate a random number between 1 and 20 and store the value in the `secretNumber` variable.
6. The `for guessesTaken in range(1, 7):` statement will create a for loop that will run six times. The `guessesTaken` variable will store the number of times the loop has run.
7. The `print('Take a guess. You have ' + str(7 - guessesTaken) + ' guesses left.')` statement will print the string `Take a guess. You have ` followed by the value of the `guessesTaken` variable subtracted from 7, followed by the string ` guesses left.` to the console.
8. The `guess = int(input())` statement will prompt the user to enter a number and store the value in the `guess` variable.
9. The `if guess < secretNumber:` statement will check if the value of the `guess` variable is less than the value of the `secretNumber` variable.
10. The `print('Your guess is too low.')` statement will print the string `Your guess is too low.` to the console.
11. The `elif guess > secretNumber:` statement will check if the value of the `guess` variable is greater than the value of the `secretNumber` variable.
12. The `print('Your guess is too high.')` statement will print the string `Your guess is too high.` to the console.
13. The `else:` statement will run if the `if` and `elif` statements are false.
14. The `break` statement will end the loop.
15. The `if guess == secretNumber:` statement will check if the value of the `guess` variable is equal to the value of the `secretNumber` variable.
16. The `print('Good job, ' + name + '! You guessed my number in ' + str(guessesTaken) + ' guesses.')` statement will print the string `Good job, ` followed by the value of the `name` variable, followed by the string `! You guessed my number in `, followed by the value of the `guessesTaken` variable, followed by the string ` guesses.` to the console.

## Next Steps
Congratulations! You have successfully created a Guess the Number game in Python. Experiment with the code and see if you can modify the application. Here are a few suggestions.
- Change the number of guesses.
- Change the range of numbers.
- Add a high score.
- Add a timer.
- Add a GUI.
- Add a database to store the high score.
- Add a leaderboard.
- Add a multiplayer mode.
- Add a difficulty setting.
