## Abstract
Creating a "Hello World" project is a classic and essential first step for anyone learning a new programming language. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of building a simple "Hello World" project using Python. This project serves as a foundation for understanding basic syntax, setting up a development environment, and executing a Python script.

## Prerequisites
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Getting Started
### Create a new project
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Select **File** > **New File** from the menu bar
3. Select **File** > **Save As** from the menu bar
4. Name the file `hello_world.py`
5. Select **File** > **Save** from the menu bar

### Write the code
1. Add the following code to the file:
<FileCode file="projects/beginners/helloworld.py" lang="python" title="Hello World" />
2. Select **File** > **Save** from the menu bar
3. Select **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu bar
4. In the terminal, 
```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers={1}
C:\Users\username\Documents\hello_world> python hello_world.py
```
5. The output should be:
```cmd title="output" showLineNumbers={1}
Hello World!
```

## Next Steps
Congratulations! You've successfully created a "Hello World" project using Python. Now that you've completed this project, you can continue learning Python by completing the next project in the series on Python Central Hub.
