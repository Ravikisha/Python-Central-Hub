title: Set Operations
description: Learn how to perform set operations in Python. We will cover the union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations. We will also cover the subset and superset operations. We are also going to talk about loops and how to use them to iterate over sets. how to join sets, and how to check if an item exists in a set and also copy a set.

In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to perform set operations in Python. We will cover the union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations. We will also cover the subset and superset operations. We are also going to talk about loops and how to use them to iterate over sets. how to join sets, and how to check if an item exists in a set and also copy a set.

## Set Operations
In the set theory, there are several operations that we can perform on sets. In this section, we are going to learn how to perform these operations in Python.

### Union (|) Operation
The union operation returns a new set that contains all the elements that are in either set. In Python, we can use the `|` operator to perform the union operation.
