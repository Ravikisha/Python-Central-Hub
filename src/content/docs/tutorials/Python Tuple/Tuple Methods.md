<!-- ```python title="change_first_item.py" showLineNumbers{1} {1,4}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

numbers[0] = 10
print(numbers)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2-3}
C:\Users\username>python change_first_item.py
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In the example above, we changed the first item in the list to 10. The rest of the items in the list remain the same. -->
