title: Pass Statement in Python
description: Learn how to use pass statement in Python. pass is a null statement in Python. Nothing happens when it is executed. It is used as a placeholder. Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. They cannot have an empty body. The interpreter would complain. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.
