## Unveiling the Power of for Loops in Python
In Python, the for loop is a versatile and fundamental construct that facilitates the iteration over a sequence of elements. Whether you're working with lists, strings, or other iterable objects, the for loop simplifies the process of executing a set of statements for each item in the sequence. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the syntax, functionality, and best practices associated with for loops in Python.

### What Is a While Loop?
A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

The while loop is used extensively in Python and alone with for and if-else loops, forms the basis of manipulating data in the language.

### Syntax of while Loop in Python
The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is âˆ’

```python
while expression:
   statement(s)
```

Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

:::note
In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.

:::tip
A while loop is also known as condition-controlled loop.

<!-- ```python title="for_loop.py" showLineNumbers{1} {3-5}
# for loop
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]
sum = 0
for val in numbers:
    sum = sum+val
print("The sum is", sum)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2-3}
C:\Users\Your Name> python for_loop.py
The sum is 48
```

In this program, we have used the for loop to iterate over a list and calculate the sum of numbers. We initialize the `sum` variable to zero and iterate over each element of the list using a for loop and add it to the `sum` variable. Finally, we print the `sum` variable which contains the sum of numbers in the given list. -->

## Example of while Loop in Python
Here is an example of while loop in Python:

```python title="while_loop.py" showLineNumbers{1} {2-6}
# while loop
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]
sum = 0
i = 0
while i < len(numbers):
    sum = sum + numbers[i]
    i = i+1
print("The sum is", sum)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2-3}
C:\Users\Your Name> python while_loop.py
The sum is 48
```
