In Python, we can concatenate strings using the `+` operator. The `+` operator allows us to add two or more strings together. Let's look at some examples.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = string1 + string2
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
HelloWorld
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings using the `+` operator. The `+` operator concatenates the second string to the end of the first string.

## Adding a Space

We can add a space between two strings by adding an empty string (`""` or `''`) to the first string. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = string1 + " " + string2
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello World
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings with a space in between. We have added an empty string (`""`) with a space in between to the first string.

## Concatenate Strings of Different Data Types

We can concatenate strings of different data types in Python. But we need to convert the non-string data types to strings before concatenating them. We can use the `str()` function to convert non-string data types to strings. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
number = 5
# concatenate strings
string2 = string1 + str(number)
print(string2)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello5
```

In the above example, we have concatenated a string and an integer. We have converted the integer to a string using the `str()` function before concatenating it with the string.

## Concatenate Strings Using join()

We can also concatenate strings using the `join()` method. The `join()` method takes an iterable as an argument and concatenates the elements of the iterable to the string. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = "".join([string1, string2])
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
HelloWorld
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings using the `join()` method. We have passed a list of strings to the `join()` method. The `join()` method has concatenated the strings in the list and returned the concatenated string.

## Concatenate Strings Using f-strings

We can also concatenate strings using f-strings. f-strings are string literals that have an `f` at the beginning and curly braces (`{}`) containing expressions that will be replaced with their values. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = f"{string1} {string2}"
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello World
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings using f-strings. We have used curly braces (`{}`) to insert the values of the variables into the string.

:::note

f-strings are faster than other string concatenation methods. So, it is recommended to use f-strings for string concatenation. f-string is the most preferred way of string concatenation in Python. We can use f-strings to concatenate strings of different data types as well. Let's look at an example. f-string uses `f{expression}` to insert the value of an expression into a string. We use f-string to print and insert variables into a string. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
number = 5
# concatenate strings
string2 = f"{string1} {number}" # variables are also expressions
print(string2)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello 5
```

In the above example, we have concatenated a string and an integer using f-strings. We have inserted the value of the variable `string1` and `number` into the string using f-strings.

:::tip
f-strings are available in Python 3.6 and above. If you are using an older version of Python, you can use the `format()` method to concatenate strings. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = "{} {}".format(string1, string2)
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello World
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings using the `format()` method. We have used curly braces (`{}`) to insert the values of the variables into the string.

## Concatenate Strings Using % Operator

We can also concatenate strings using the `%` operator. The `%` operator is also known as the string formatting operator. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = "%s %s" % (string1, string2)
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello World
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings using the `%` operator. We have used `%s` to insert the values of the variables into the string.

:::tip
The `%` operator is available in Python 2 and Python 3. But it is recommended to use f-strings for string concatenation in Python 3.6 and above.

## Concatenate Strings Using String Slicing

We can also concatenate strings using string slicing. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = string1[:2] + string2[2:]
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
HeloWorld
```

## String Concatenation in a Loop

We can also concatenate strings in a loop. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5-7}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = ""
for i in range(5):
    string3 += string1 + string2
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
HelloWorldHelloWorldHelloWorldHelloWorldHelloWorld
```

In the above example, we have concatenated two strings in a loop. We have used the `+=` operator to concatenate the strings in the loop.

## Multiline String Concatenation

We can also concatenate multiline strings in Python. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {7}
# define strings
string1 = """Hello
World"""
string2 = """Hello
World"""
# concatenate strings
string3 = string1 + string2
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2-4}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Hello
WorldHello
World
```

## Multiple String Concatenation

We can also concatenate multiple strings in Python. Let's look at an example.

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {5}
# define strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
# concatenate strings
string3 = string1 * 3 + string2 * 2
print(string3)
```

Output:

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
HelloHelloHelloWorldWorld
```

In the above example, we have concatenated multiple strings. We have used the `*` operator to concatenate the strings.
