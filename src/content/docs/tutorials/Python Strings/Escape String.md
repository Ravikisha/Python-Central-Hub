In python, a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding. Unicode has a unique code for every character irrespective of the platform, program, or language.

You get error when you try to use a special character in a string. For example, if you use a single quote to represent a string, you will get an error.
```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
# single quote string
print('Python's string')
```

Output

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
C:\Users\Your Name> python strings.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1
    print('Python's string')
          ^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Perhaps you forgot a comma?

Escape characters in Python are special characters that don't get printed as-is but instead signal some specific action. They allow you to include special characters in strings or control the formatting of text. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the world of escape characters in Python and how they can be used to enhance text manipulation.

## Basics of Escape Characters

Escape characters are denoted by a backslash (`\`) followed by a specific character or sequence. The backslash tells Python that the character following it has a special meaning.

#### Escape Characters in Python

|1|`\n`|Newline|Inserts a new line|
|2|`\t`|Tab|Inserts a tab|
|3|`\r`|Carriage Return|Inserts a carriage return|
|4|`\b`|Backspace|Inserts a backspace|
|5|`\f`|Form Feed|Inserts a form feed|
|6|`\v`|Vertical Tab|Inserts a vertical tab|

|16|`\ooo`|Octal Character|Inserts an octal character|

## Newline Escape Character

The newline escape character (`\n`) inserts a new line into a string. It's useful for formatting text and creating line breaks. For example, you can use it to print a string on multiple lines:

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
# print string on multiple lines
print('This is a string\non multiple lines')
```

Output

```cmd title="command" showLineNumbers{1} {2}

## Tab Escape Character

The tab escape character (`\t`) inserts a tab into a string. It's useful for formatting text and creating tabbed sections. For example, you can use it to print a string with a tab:

```python title="strings.py" showLineNumbers{1} {2}
# print string with tab
print('This is a string\twith a tab')
